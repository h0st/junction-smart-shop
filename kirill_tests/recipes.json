Add garlic to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Combine honey and lemon juice in a small bowl. Add the sauce to the pan. Continue cooking for 1-3 minutes or until the salmon is fully cooked and looks opaque and the sauce is thick.Take off of the heat.

		"type": "soup",
		"ingridients": "olive oil; onion; basil; tomato paste; tomatoes in juice; baking soda; vegetable stock; white beans; sea salt; garlic cloves; parsley; olive oil; parmesan cheese; kosher salt; ground black pepper; bread",
		"recipe_text": "In a medium pot or sauce pan (about 3 quarts), heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and dried basil and cook about 5 minutes, until onion is soft. Stir in tomato paste for a minute or two until blended, then add diced tomatoes, baking soda, stock, and beans, and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Reduce heat and cover, and simmer the soup for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. While soup simmers, mince the garlic and fresh herbs together, if using, and set aside. Remove soup from heat and cool slightly, then blend in batches or with an immersion blender until smooth. Return soup to the pot to keep warm over low heat, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil, black pepper, the herb mixture, and parmesan croutons. Croutons: Preheat oven to 400 (F). Mix oil, parmesan, salt, and a few grinds of black pepper to form a paste in a small bowl. In a mixing bowl, toss bread cubes with the cheese paste. Spread on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer with as little space as possible between cubes. Bake for 5 minutes on the middle rack, then stir and bake another 5 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. If some of the croutons stick together, that's fine (and encouraged)! Cool for a few minutes, break apart most of the croutons, and serve a handful over each bowl of soup. "
